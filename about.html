        <p>
            I am a motivated Electronics and Communication Engineering graduate with a keen interest in software development. I have worked on web-based projects using HTML, CSS, Python, Django, and Flask. I enjoy learning new technologies and applying them to real-time projects.

I am a dedicated and enthusiastic fresher looking for an entry-level opportunity where I can enhance my skills, contribute to the organization, and grow professionally.
